/** @file drm_gem.c
 *
 * This file provides some of the base ioctls and library routines for
 * the graphics memory manager implemented by each device driver.
 *
 * Because various devices have different requirements in terms of
 * synchronization and migration strategies, implementing that is left up to
 * the driver, and all that the general API provides should be generic --
 * allocating objects, reading/writing data with the cpu, freeing objects.
 * Even there, platform-dependent optimizations for reading/writing data with
 * the CPU mean we'll likely hook those out to driver-specific calls.  However,
 * the DRI2 implementation wants to have at least allocate/mmap be generic.
 *
 * The goal was to have swap-backed object allocation managed through
 * struct file.  However, file descriptors as handles to a struct file have
 * two major failings:
 * - Process limits prevent more than 1024 or so being used at a time by
 *   default.
 * - Inability to allocate high fds will aggravate the X Server's select()
 *   handling, and likely that of many GL client applications as well.
 *
 * This led to a plan of using our own integer IDs (called handles, following
 * DRM terminology) to mimic fds, and implement the fd syscalls we need as
 * ioctls.  The objects themselves will still include the struct file so
 * that we can transition to fds if the required kernel infrastructure shows
 * up at a later data, and as our interface with shmfs for memory allocation.
